# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- Added Update mode to claude-md skill that scans the codebase and syncs CLAUDE.md with current project state

- Removed 9 non-execution reference files across skills (changelogs, version history, research background, development test cases, internal tracking)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- Added review-code skill for PR-level code review with SOLID, security, and quality checks graded P0-P3

### Changed
- Rewrote changelog skill as single-flow release tool, removing three-mode branching that caused mode-skipping failures

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-13

### Changed
- Restructured changelog skill into self-contained mode flows, eliminating cross-reference jumps that caused mode skipping
- Improved production-audit skill to Grade A with consistent checkpoint fields and corrected agent counts

- Added "How to use" column with concrete examples to all skill tables in README

### Fixed
- Fixed production-audit orchestrator fork conflict where `context: fork` silently blocked sub-agent dispatch via Task/TeamCreate
- Added definitive mechanical check to review-skill: `context: fork` combined with team/task tools now triggers M2 violation

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- Restructured changelog skill to three-mode workflow (update, push, release) with explicit push separation
- Broadened research skill description triggers for better auto-invocation
- Updated README with revised changelog and research skill descriptions

### Fixed
- Fixed research skill unable to dispatch sub-agents by removing incorrect `context: fork` and inlining agent allocation table

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- Added Debug skill with four-phase root-cause methodology, tracing references, and test pressure scenarios
- Added comprehensive reference docs for cc-hooks skill (input-output schemas, command-vs-prompt guide, tool-names list, troubleshooting, five hook templates)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `hooks/` to `context-intelligence-hooks/` (update paths in `.claude/settings.json`)
- Improved 11 skills to Grade A compliance (cc-hooks, claude-md, create-skill, find-skills, frontend-design, mermaid-diagrams, production-audit, readme-md, smart-merge, ultrathink)
- Hardened review-skill with pre-flight validation, post-fix re-evaluation loop, and actionable fix instructions
- Improved changelog skill examples with concrete output snippets showing exact format
- Refined review-skill references with hyphenated filenames and expanded mode descriptions
- Updated README for 22 skills (added debug and cc-hooks, removed orla3-production)

### Removed
- Removed orla3-production skill (replaced by production-audit)

### Fixed
- Fixed 8 hook defects: ERROR_PATTERNS regex, DOCS_COLLECTION default mismatch, loadMcpConfig diagnostic mode, guard file TOCTOU race, input sanitisation in searchMemory, path traversal validation, connection churn, and incomplete documentation

### Security
