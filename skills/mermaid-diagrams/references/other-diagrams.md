# Other Diagram Types

State diagrams, git graphs, gantt charts, and pie/quadrant charts for specialized visualization needs.

## State Diagrams

State diagrams model state machines, showing states and transitions. Ideal for modeling object lifecycles, UI states, or workflow status.

<example name="Basic State">

### Basic Syntax
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Processing : start
    Processing --> Complete : success
    Processing --> Failed : error
    Complete --> [*]
    Failed --> Idle : retry
```

</example>

<example name="Composite States">

### Composite States
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Active

    state Active {
        [*] --> Pending
        Pending --> InProgress : assign
        InProgress --> Review : submit
        Review --> InProgress : request_changes
        Review --> Done : approve
    }

    Active --> Cancelled : cancel
    Active --> [*] : complete
```

</example>

<example name="Order Lifecycle">

### Order Lifecycle Example
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft

    Draft --> Submitted : submit
    Draft --> Cancelled : cancel

    Submitted --> PaymentPending : process
    PaymentPending --> PaymentFailed : payment_error
    PaymentPending --> Confirmed : payment_success

    PaymentFailed --> PaymentPending : retry_payment
    PaymentFailed --> Cancelled : abandon

    Confirmed --> Processing : start_fulfillment
    Processing --> Shipped : ship
    Shipped --> Delivered : confirm_delivery
    Delivered --> [*]

    Cancelled --> [*]

    note right of PaymentPending : Awaiting payment\nconfirmation
    note right of Processing : Items being\npicked & packed
```

</example>

<example name="Concurrent States">

### Concurrent States (Fork/Join)
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Checkout

    state Checkout {
        [*] --> fork_state
        state fork_state <<fork>>
        fork_state --> ValidateCart
        fork_state --> ValidatePayment
        fork_state --> ValidateShipping

        ValidateCart --> join_state
        ValidatePayment --> join_state
        ValidateShipping --> join_state
        state join_state <<join>>

        join_state --> ProcessOrder
    }

    Checkout --> Complete : success
    Checkout --> Failed : validation_error
```

## Best Practices by Diagram Type

### State Diagrams
- Begin every diagram with `[*] --> InitialState` and end with `FinalState --> [*]`.
- Label every transition with the trigger event name (e.g., `: submit`, `: cancel`).
- Wrap 3+ related states in a `state` composite block and name it after the lifecycle phase.
- Add `note right of StateName` to explain non-obvious transition guards.

### Git Graphs
- Set `id:` on every commit to a short descriptive label (e.g., `id: "add auth"`).
- Tag release commits on main with `tag: "v1.0.0"`.
- Name branches with the `type/name` convention (e.g., `feature/auth`, `hotfix/security`).

### Gantt Charts
- Add `excludes weekends` for realistic timelines.
- Mark critical path tasks with `crit` and key dates with `milestone`.
- Group tasks into `section` blocks named after project phases.
- Use `after taskId` for dependencies rather than hardcoded dates where possible.

### Pie/Quadrant Charts
- Cap pie charts at 5-7 segments. Merge small slices into "Other".
- Add `showData` to every pie chart so values are visible.
- Label all four quadrants with actionable names (e.g., "Do First", "Eliminate").
