## Selection Guidelines

### By Question Type

| Question | Recommended Charts |
|----------|-------------------|
| "How much?" | Bar, Bullet, Gauge |
| "How does it change over time?" | Line, Area, Sparkline |
| "What's the breakdown?" | Pie, Donut, Treemap, Stacked Bar |
| "How is it distributed?" | Histogram, Box Plot, Violin |
| "Is there a relationship?" | Scatter, Bubble, Heatmap |
| "How does it flow?" | Sankey, Funnel |

### By Data Size

| Data Points | Recommended | Avoid |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 2-5 items | Pie, Bar, Donut | Scatter, Heatmap |
| 6-12 items | Bar, Line, Treemap | Pie (too many slices) |
| 13-50 items | Heatmap, Scatter, Treemap | Pie, grouped bars |
| 50+ items | Scatter, Histogram, Heatmap | Most categorical charts |

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Better Alternative |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Pie with 10+ slices | Impossible to compare | Horizontal bar, sorted |
| 3D charts | Distorts perception | 2D equivalents |
| Dual Y-axes | Misleading correlations | Separate charts or normalize |
| Truncated Y-axis | Exaggerates differences | Start at zero or show break |
| Too many lines (>5) | Visual noise | Highlight key series, dim others |
